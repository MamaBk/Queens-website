            ADA, named after Ada Lovelace (the first female coder), is a non-profit programme which aims to educate young women of colour to become Front-End Developers and join the tech industry. ADA provides an immersive, mentored, fully-funded web development education to young, African, women.
          </p>
          <p>
            ADA's mission is to empower. They give young, African women the tools and confidence to become successful game-changers in the field of technology by providing them with immersive, mentored, fully-funded Front-End Development education.

                The African Developers Academy had limited capacity in its first ever year, and so had to be rigorous in their testing and eventual selection of the student body of 2019/2020. This meant that students had to apply first through Harambe, where they completed a series of aptitude tests to make sure that they had what it takes to be a web developer.
              </p>
              <p>
                There were 500 applications, 100 selected candidates through Harambe and only 12 spots. This means that only 2% of applicants would make it through.
              </p>
              <p>
                All of the 100 selected candidates were invited to take part in challenges hosted by ADA which put them to the test - checking for resilience, strength of character, attitude and of course ability. The women who made it through proved themselves in many ways, and continued to do so throughout their studies.

            Every single day in the learnership was a blessing to me as I was learning something new. There were 12 ladies in the end. We all worked really hard to be here and I know I was blessed to have been chosen amongst the 12 from the initial 216 participants. From the day we started at the board game challenge day, to the last teaching day in the learnership, I was in a state of bliss because I have acquired so many skills. I can't help but be truly grateful to ADA for believing in me. The day we were taught HTML, at first it was a challenge but later I started to understand the fundamentals. Then came CSS - which I found a little more challenging, i think because anything new is scary, from turtle academy to the actual Software Development system and doing the actual work, It was real and i felt like it would take long to grasp, but we had amazing teachers that broke down everything for me and i eventually understood what was happening and was able to create a styled website page which made me really happy. I was so anxious and thought it was beyond me, but the lecturers continued supporting and believing in me, which made it easier and made me want to do more. By the end of semester one, I was okay with my HTML and CSS. When we reopened for semester two, we were introduced to Javascript which was a real challenge indeed!
          </p>
          <p class="code">
            The lectures made it nice to work though, regardless how hard we thought something was, they kept on teaching and encouraged us to do and be better. We learned a lot really and what I am realising is, the learning doesn't stop! There is definitely something new to learn every single day. One must just be willing to push themselves and really be ready to absorb new and exciting things. We made a lot of exciting projects to practice what we learned, my time here was so worth it and I really do feel like a new person who is ready to embark on a journey of Technology.
            <br>
            Covid  19 came at a very unexpected time, I have to say, I was worried of what will happen to the program: are the ladies safe in their homes? etc. But I am happy it didn't mess up with the program and now we all came back safe and healthy. In our fourth semester, we are given an opportunity to do some other lovely things to enhance our skills. Iâ€™m personally looking forward to reminding myself about the database lessons. All in all, this was the best thing that has ever happened in my life!
