            African Developers Academy provides an immersive, mentored, fully-funded software-development education to young, African, women. They are different in that they:
            ARE FEMALE-FOCUSED. They provide a safe learning environment for women who have an aptitude for maths and science but haven’t had the opportunity to pursue a career in software development. Guidance is provided to each student by designated mentors who provide emotional support and career coaching. The presence of female mentors, and previous students returning as mentors, serve as role models for all students. <a href="https://www.adadev.org.za/"> -Visit ADA's website</a>

                I was writing assessments at Harambee and I managed to get in a bootcamp that focused on exploring Data Science. They wanted 10 people out of 50 of us that applied. Unfortunately, I didn't make the cut, but harambee told us something will come up. I got a call to come write another assessment for a company that wants to teach ladies how to code  - and that was the beginning of my journey with ADA!
              </p>
              <p class="code">
                After passing the assessment, we were called to come to Jozihub for one full day. Our first day was really nice because we had create a board game, create the assets for it and then play it. This was the best day for me, we came up with an idea and our  game won 1st prize! It was indeed a privilege to be appreciated that way on our very first day. There were more than 70 beautiful and talented ladies on the day, but they only needed 30 women for the next phase of the process, and I was blessed to make the cut. 
                In the bootcamp they introduced us to ‘Turtle Academy’ (Turtle Academy is an online software where we work through the material to build up our skills in programming.)which, at the time, I found really challenging and intimidating. There were 30 talented, bright and creative ladies that were working so hard to make the cut, as they initially said they wanted 10 of us. I knew that I had to work hard enough to make this cut, I refused to be denied this opportunity again!  The day came where we had to know if we will be attending the learnership or not. When I got the email, I couldn't help but cry because I knew that a life changing journey is about to begin!

            Every single day in the learnership was a blessing to me as I was learning something new. There were 12 ladies in the end. We all worked really hard to be here and I know I was blessed to have been chosen amongst the 12 from the initial 216 participants. From the day we started at the board game challenge day, to the last teaching day in the learnership, I was in a state of bliss because I have acquired so many skills. I can't help but be truly grateful to ADA for believing in me. The day we were taught HTML, at first it was a challenge but later I started to understand the fundamentals. Then came CSS - which I found a little more challenging, i think because anything new is scary, from turtle academy to the actual Software Development system and doing the actual work, It was real and i felt like it would take long to grasp, but we had amazing teachers that broke down everything for me and i eventually understood what was happening and was able to create a styled website page which made me really happy. I was so anxious and thought it was beyond me, but the lecturers continued supporting and believing in me, which made it easier and made me want to do more. By the end of semester one, I was okay with my HTML and CSS. When we reopened for semester two, we were introduced to Javascript which was a real challenge indeed!
          </p>
          <p class="code">
            The lectures made it nice to work though, regardless how hard we thought something was, they kept on teaching and encouraged us to do and be better. We learned a lot really and what I am realising is, the learning doesn't stop! There is definitely something new to learn every single day. One must just be willing to push themselves and really be ready to absorb new and exciting things. We made a lot of exciting projects to practice what we learned, my time here was so worth it and I really do feel like a new person who is ready to embark on a journey of Technology.
            <br>
            Covid  19 came at a very unexpected time, I have to say, I was worried of what will happen to the program: are the ladies safe in their homes? etc. But I am happy it didn't mess up with the program and now we all came back safe and healthy. In our fourth semester, we are given an opportunity to do some other lovely things to enhance our skills. I’m personally looking forward to reminding myself about the database lessons. All in all, this was the best thing that has ever happened in my life!
